# Welcome to Jason Sudeikis great show on how to really tell a story

You can view the tribute page on [Ted Lasso](https://codepen.io/Erdogan90/pen/ExvdKYz) 

Here is a link to the full [Dart Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ4YSXv6Xkg&t=121s) the monologue starts at 2 mins and 17 seconds in

## Why i chose this?

I had many ideas on things to chose to do a tribute page on, But when i saw this scene 4 weeks ago for the first time, it stuck with me

I felt like everyone should see the scene. And understand why it might be one of the best story telling performance TV has scene in 10 years.

We tend to associate good acting or a moving piece with the idea of a performance being based around something sad or upsetting. 

Yet he produced a scene that people can watch and follow without thinking of anything else that could be happening in there lives by just great story telling.

He made myself feel like a little child who was listening to there parent or grandparent tell a story again. 

### Using freecodecamp

I enjoyed myself as i worked through the HTMl5 and CSS modules.

They were fun but very complex. I found myself going back and forth trying to remeber what i did before to try and maintain as much of the knowledge possible.

However i know it's something i will get used to the more i practise which is why im trying to complete every lesson within there.

#### Creating the Tribute page

Very tough! it was a struggle to remember what i had learned and apply the knowledge however after spending lnegthy amount of time going back and forth between youtube tuorials
and linked guides i managed to get through it. 

I found my first coding of a website rather strange. 

Strange in the sense i didnt know why i was doing certain things until i did and worked backwards from the solution to the task which allowed me to actually understand why i did
what i did.

I am happy with my first attempt but i am aware of list of things that i need to keep wroking on to ensure i learn the language better.

1. _The proper way to close a div, h1, id etc_
2. _Remmebering the punction mark . representing class_
3. _Id is represented in CSS by #_
4. _Understanding how debug my own errors_
